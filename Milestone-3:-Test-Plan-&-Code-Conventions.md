# Due Oct 30th

## Code Convention
**Language**

Our group has all agreed on using Python 3.8.5 to work on this project. 

**Docstring**

Our group will be following PEP 257 for docstrings throughout the whole project. The reason why we pick PEP 257 is because most of us are familiar with this docstring convention, so it is easier for us to follow and understand as well. As for the format, we will be following google format.

Here is some example for the google format : 

    """
    This is an example of Google style.

    Arguments:
        param1: This is the first param.
        param2: This is a second param.

    Returns:
        This is a description of what is returned.

    Raises:
        KeyError: Raises an exception.

    """

**Comments**

- Group members can add comments if they think that part is too complex or abstract.
- Limit the length of the comment line to 80 characters, after 80 words programmers have to continue in the newline.
- Start with # and leave white space in between the # and the starting character.

    **1.Above line Comments**

    - Above line comments is better for explaining a single line of code.
    - Comment line have to be above the line of code.

    Example: 

        # sum the param with 5
        new_param = param + 5


    **2.Block Comments**

    - When docstring is not used in that function, block comments will be used.
    - Leave a blank comment line in between two comments, making comments easier to read.
    - Block comments are better to use to explain a section of code. They help to let others understand that certain parts of the 
      function.

    Example:
    
        Def squareRoot(param):
            # Calculating the square root of the given param without using
            # any built-in function
            #
            # a print out will be called and print out the solution
 
            param = param**(1/2)
            print(param)

**Naming**

- Function will be added underscore at the back of the function name if it requires testing, e.g. sampleFunction_().
- Variable name will be separated via underscore without any capitalization, e.g. sample_variable.

**If-else statement Formatting**

- No more than or equal 5 logical symbols inside the if-else statement, if so switch to nested loop.

**Constant**

- Use uppercase for the whole variable name, and will use the underscore to do the separation.

Example:

    Single-word variable name. (CONSTANT)
    Variable with more than one word. (SOME_CONSTANT)

**Bracket Format**

- There will be a single whitespace between the parameters or variables.

Example:

    #example 1
    Def sampleFunction(param1, param2, param3, param4):
        â€¦

    #example 2
    sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,]

**Space and Tab**

- Space will be used to create whitespace most of the time.
- Only use Tab to create the whitespace for the function gap.
- Four spaces will be used for indentation.

Example:

    Def sampleFunction(param1, param2, param3, param4):
        # single whitespace between the symbols and parameters.
        # Tab was used to create the whitespace in front of sum_result.
        sum_result = param1 + param2 + param3 + param4
