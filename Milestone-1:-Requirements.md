## Product Description

Our product is a personal finance application that allows users to securely access several bank accounts and PayPal all in one place. After creating an account with our platform, users can link their bank accounts and their PayPal account. The users will also be given an option to auto-login in which case the login info to their financial institutions will be securely stored for easy login so they never have to worry about separately logging into their respective financial institutions ever again.

Once connected with a bank account users will be able to filter and view their transaction data going back 12 months. In addition to this, the system will also provide users an easy way to keep track of available funds to help users avoid overdraft fees.

In addition to the ability to check account balance and up to 12 months of transaction data, our application also allows users to create a custom financial plan. Users can use this feature to create monthly/yearly budgets and keep track of their long term or short term financial goals. Future plans include providing users with financial education resources and news. To help users come up with a solid plan the notes section will offer financial information from reputable financial educational websites such as Investopedia. Users will also have access to a customizable news feed where they read the latest articles on topics such as personal finance, real estate, business, and investing.
